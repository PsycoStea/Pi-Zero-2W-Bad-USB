# Ducky Script Command Reference â€” Pi Zero 2W BadUSB

This project supports a set of Ducky Script-style commands in your payload (`payload.txt`). Use these commands (one per line) for automating keyboard actions. No programming required!

---

## Syntax

- Each command is on its own line.
- Blank lines and lines starting with `REM` (comments) are ignored.
- Commands are case-insensitive (e.g., `STRING`, `String`, or `string` are all valid).
